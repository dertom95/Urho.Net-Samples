# Urho.Net-Samples

Samples for the Urho.Net cross platofrm C# game development framework 

https://github.com/elix22/Urho.Net

Make sure you are using the latest Urho.Net framework package.

Each folder is a fully self contained Visual Studio code project , containing all the scripts and tools to allow pleasent and fluent development.
  The downside of it is that this is a hugh repo.

You can download a single folder by using SVN , for example downloading only the MultipleViewports sample project :

`svn co https://github.com/elix22/Urho.Net-Samples/trunk/MultipleViewports  MultipleViewports`

Every folder can be downloaded in the same way by using svn :

`svn co https://github.com/elix22/Urho.Net-Samples/trunk/FOLDER-NAME  FOLDER-NAME`
